To run the Jupyter notebook, you will need to download the dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset

This project includes EDA of the heart disease data set and three machine learning models to classify the data set(SVM, KNN, and Random Forest Classifier). Doig so I hope to find the relationship between spsecific features and how that may impact heart health. Also, I hoep to provide insight on how we may autmate sreening processes for people with heart diseses.
